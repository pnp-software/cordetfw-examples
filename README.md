# cordetfw-examples
This repository contains the demo application for the [CORDET Framework](https://github.com/pnp-software/cordetfw).

Starting from release 1.0.0 of the CORDET Framework, we are no longer supporting/maintaining the cordetfw-examples. The cordetfw-examples project had been created as a test bed for the CORDET Framework at a time when there were no industrial applications of the framework but its release 1.0.0 has some industrial heritage and is being used in a couple of industrial projects and therefore we believe that we no longer need the cordetfw-examples project.
